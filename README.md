Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

Implemented code for finding the degree of tweet hashtags graph in a 60 secs window.

Accounted for out of order tweets

Added JUnit Test cases testing various boundary cases

All the external jars required for execution are placed in external_jars directory

To Run code
Place the tweets.txt file in tweet_input directory.

execute ./run.sh 

.class files are generated in src/Coding_Challenge directory 

output is written into output.txt in tweet_output directory

All the test cases are placed in insight_testsuite/tests/<Test_Cases>/tweet_input directory.

For running test cases

execute ./run_test.sh

If all 8 test cases pass, the output will be OK ( 8 tests)
